IMDb's freely distributed text-file database is easly accessible for non-profit use

By scanning the mpaa-rating-reasons file, creating a reformated file, and collecting information
through parsing the file, various recurrent 'reasons' were collected and catalogued to be used in
analysis by WEKA. This was my first experience parsing language into phrases and it went particularly 
well. Certain algorithms were then run on the collected data to determine the most important factors 
in the ratings of films, and how those factors change with time.

The file included in this repo represents the last phase of development for this project.
